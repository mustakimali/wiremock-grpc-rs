# wiremock-grpc-macros

Proc macros for [wiremock-grpc](https://crates.io/crates/wiremock-grpc).

**Do not use this crate directly.** Instead, depend on `wiremock-grpc` which re-exports the macros:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
wiremock-grpc = "0.4"
```

See the [wiremock-grpc documentation](https://docs.rs/wiremock-grpc) for usage instructions.
